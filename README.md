# BFA Communication Design Thesis, Spring 2020
Repository for Thesis 2, Spring 2020.

## Course description
Thesis 1 & Thesis 2 are a year-long self-driven investigation into the research, prototyping and design of an identified question, critique, or point of view. It provides an opportunity for design innovation and inquiry through the rigorous research and development of a capstone project, through various pathways across platforms. The goal of the first semester is to research, develop and articulate a thesis concept and create an initial prototype, including designed presentations of research and process. Thesis 1, in particular, focuses on process, which includes primary and secondary research, prototyping, documenting and writing about one’s own work. The semester culminates in a finished project or proposal, written statement, and presentation of work.

## The work of thesis
Thesis is as much about the design process as design projects. By moving through the design process—research, ideation, prototyping, iteration, and presentation—students will begin to develop projects by way of exploration across multiple media. Students will be asked to reflect on how their ideas—as expressed through design—sits alongside historical precedent and shapes culture in the present. It provides an opportunity for visual innovation through the development of a rigorous design process. This includes articulation of research, which contextualizes how one’s work posits itself within larger historical, cultural, social, and technological frameworks.

## Course outline
###Week 1–10: Final Project 
Students undertake individual cycles of prototyping, user testing and implementation throughout the first part of the semester and will be evaluated through both individual critiques with faculty and group critiques. They will appreciate the current best practice and methods—demonstrated through successful examples in class—to create a successful implementation of their design proposal. Students are expected to deliver a final body of work that reflects professionalism and advanced formal proficiency that can be successfully presented to a panel of external design professionals. Students will appreciate methods to speak and write critically and in an engaging manner about their work and the influences that inform it.

### Week 11–15: Professional Practice
Through workshops, studio visits,  and in-class exercises, students will expand their knowledge of the field and appreciate professional practices. They will be enabled to transfer their professional experiences and institutional insights to their own design practice and prepare assets to communicate to the community including an online portfolio and CV. Students will understand the myriad of ways of participating in the current communication design community through an engaging mix of best practice as demonstrated in class, through lectures, and studio visits.

### CD Lecture Series
Students are required to attend 3 CD Design Lectures throughout fall term. The lectures provide an opportunity to see and hear how professional designers articulate and contextualize  individual projects, their body of work, audience, and impact. A 200 word response should be submitted for each lecture attended, as well as a selfie from the event.
