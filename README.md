# BFA Communication Design Thesis, Spring 2020
Repository for Thesis 2, Spring 2020.

## Course description
Thesis 1 & Thesis 2 are a year-long self-driven investigation into the research, prototyping and design of an identified question, critique, or point of view. It provides an opportunity for design innovation and inquiry through the rigorous research and development of a capstone project, through various pathways across platforms. The goal of the first semester is to research, develop and articulate a thesis concept and create an initial prototype, including designed presentations of research and process. Thesis 1, in particular, focuses on process, which includes primary and secondary research, prototyping, documenting and writing about one’s own work. The semester culminates in a finished project or proposal, written statement, and presentation of work.

## The work of thesis
Thesis is as much about the design process as design projects. By moving through the design process—research, ideation, prototyping, iteration, and presentation—students will begin to develop projects by way of exploration across multiple media. Students will be asked to reflect on how their ideas—as expressed through design—sits alongside historical precedent and shapes culture in the present. It provides an opportunity for visual innovation through the development of a rigorous design process. This includes articulation of research, which contextualizes how one’s work posits itself within larger historical, cultural, social, and technological frameworks.

## Course outline
### Week 1–10: Final Project 
Students undertake individual cycles of prototyping, user testing and implementation throughout the first part of the semester and will be evaluated through both individual critiques with faculty and group critiques. They will appreciate the current best practice and methods—demonstrated through successful examples in class—to create a successful implementation of their design proposal. Students are expected to deliver a final body of work that reflects professionalism and advanced formal proficiency that can be successfully presented to a panel of external design professionals. Students will appreciate methods to speak and write critically and in an engaging manner about their work and the influences that inform it.
